Iris Flower Classification Project
Welcome to the Iris Flower Classification project! This repository showcases my work in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning, specifically focusing on the classic Iris flower dataset.

About the Project
In this project, I implemented a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in the context of supervised learning.

Key Features
Dataset: Utilized the well-known Iris dataset, a benchmark in the field.
Machine Learning Model: Implemented a classification model using popular algorithms such as Decision Trees or Support Vector Machines.
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Getting Started
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Explore the Jupyter notebook or Python script to understand the workflow.
